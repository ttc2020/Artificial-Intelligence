	<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #6b6fe3"><u>Use Of AI In Education</u></h1>
	<p>Educational institutions such as elementary, higher, and professional learning environments are increasingly shifting to AI. The primary reason behind this transformation is to provide better services to learners.<br>

    Compared to traditional learning methods, the modernized learning ways using AI will help learners to achieve their learning objectives. But, one of the major challenge to education service providers is the grasping power of students as it varies from each other. Learners understand the concept at different rates. Learning and thinking abilities of each student is different.<br>

    Artificial intelligence is the best option to overcome all challenges in learning new things. AI technology in education makes your learning process seamless. It helps educators or mentors to provide more better, informed, and personalized services to students.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence-based education apps are playing a vital role in improving the way of learning and training processes. Irrespective of location and time, students can access the course materials and can listen to the subject demo sessions. Thanks to wonderful and amazing AI technology. We can get everything at our fingertips.</p><br>

    <h2>Teacher and AI collaboration</h2>
    <p>AI has already been applied to education primarily in some tools that help develop skills and testing systems. As AI educational solutions continue to mature, the hope is that AI can help fill needs gaps in learning and teaching and allow schools and teachers to do more than ever before. AI can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline admin tasks to allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability—uniquely human capabilities where machines would struggle. By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for AI in education is one where they work together for the best outcome for students. Since the students of today will need to work in a future where AI is the reality, it’s important that our educational institutions expose students to and use the technology.</p>
    <h2>Universal access for all students</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence tools can help make global classrooms available to all including those who speak different languages or who might have visual or hearing impairments. Presentation Translator is a free plug-in for PowerPoint that creates subtitles in real time for what the teacher is saying. This also opens up possibilities for students who might not be able to attend school due to illness or who require learning at a different level or on a particular subject that isn’t available in their own school. AI can help break down silos between schools and between traditional grade levels.</p>
    <h2>Automate admin tasks</h2>
    <p>An educator spends a tremendous amount of time grading homework and tests. AI can step in and make quick work out of these tasks while at the same time offering recommendations for how to close the gaps in learning. Although machines can already grade multiple-choice tests, they are very close to being able to assess written responses as well. As AI steps in to automate admin tasks, it opens up more time for teachers to spend with each student. There is much potential for AI to create more efficient enrollment and admissions processes.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #6b6fe3"><u>Use Of AI in Health Care.</u></h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence simplifies the lives of patients, doctors and hospital administrators by performing tasks that are typically done by humans, but in less time and at a fraction of the cost. One of AI's biggest potential benefits is to help people stay healthy so they don't need a doctor, or at least not as often. The use of AI and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in consumer health applications is already helping people.</p><br>
    <img src="health.png"><br>
    <p>In 2015, misdiagnosing illness and medical error accounted for 10% of all US deaths. In light of that, the promise of improving the diagnostic process is one of AI's most exciting healthcare applications. Incomplete medical histories and large case loads can lead to deadly human errors. Immune to those variables, AI can predict and diagnose disease at a faster rate than most medical professionals.
    </p>
    <p>For Example, Buoy Health which is an AI-based symptom and cure checker that uses algorithms to diagnose and treat illness. Here's how it works: a chatbot listens to a patient’s symptoms and health concerns, then guides that patient to the correct care based on its diagnosis. Harvard Medical School is just one of the many hospitals and healthcare providers that uses Buoy’s AI to help diagnose and treat patients more quickly.</p><br>
    <img src="buoy.png" style="border: none;"><br>
    <h2>Developing New Medicines with the help of AI</h2>
    <p>The drug development industry is bogged down by skyrocketing development costs and research that takes thousands of human hours. It costs about $2.6 billion to put each drug through clinical trials, and only 10% of those drugs are successfully brought to market. Due to breakthroughs in technology, biopharmaceutical companies are quickly taking notice of the efficiency, accuracy and knowledge that AI can provide.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest AI breakthroughs in drug development came in 2007 when researchers tasked a robot named Adam with researching functions of yeast. Adam scoured billions of data points in public databases to hypothesize about the functions of 19 genes within yeast, predicting 9 new and accurate hypotheses. Adam’s robot friend, Eve, discovered that triclosan, a common ingredient in toothpaste, can combat malaria-based parasites.</p><br>
    <img src="medicine.jpg">
    <p>A range of AI-based robots have emerged during recent months that help in the COVID-19 battle by reducing contact between patients and health care workers – minimizing the risk of cross-infections. For example, Chinese firms are using drones and robots to perform contactless delivery and to spray disinfectants in public areas to minimize the risk of cross-infection. Other robots are checking people for fever and other COVID-19 symptoms and dispensing hand sanitizer foam and gel. Robots are also being used to serve food and medicine to patients and disinfecting rooms to minimize contact with human staff.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #6b6fe3"><u>Use Of AI In Our Daily Life</u></h1>
    <p>Today, AI plays a role in many aspects of our daily lives, from commuting to shopping to browsing the web. AI software development is a massive market, and the technology is improving all the time. </p><br>
    <img src="daily.jpg"><br>
    <h2>Digital Assistants</h2>
    <p>Digital assistants like the Google Home and Amazon Alexa have exploded in popularity in the last few years. You can use digital assistants for a wide variety of purposes, but the following are some of the most common uses:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Message dictation</li>
    	<li>Internet searches</li>
    	<li>Alarms and timers</li>
    	<li>Scheduling</li>
    	<li>Reminders</li>
    	<li>Media Playback</li>
    	<li>Calculations</li>
    </ul><br>
    <img src="digital.jpg"><br>
    <p>Some digital assistants also offer home automation, which allows you to use the technology to control your thermostat, lights, garage door, and other devices. Many digital assistants use AI to understand the nuances of human language. This allows the devices to process full sentences spoken by the user and respond with natural speech. The natural language abilities will get better and better over time until digital assistants sound just like humans.</p>
    <h2>Online Shopping and Services</h2>
    <p>If you ever shop online, there’s a good chance that artificial intelligence has been a part of your e-commerce experience. AI plays a role in digital assistant technology, web searches, and social media advertising, which are all major components of online shopping. If you see an ad on Facebook for a product you’ve been Googling, it’s likely that AI was involved at some point in the process.</p>
    <img src="shopping.jpg">
    <p>Another important function of AI in online shopping is chatbots, which are typically available 24/7 to answer questions and offer solutions to common problems. Although chatbots aren’t always as helpful as speaking to a human representative, they can offer quick assistance for easy issues.AI can also help to personalize your shopping experience by gathering your user information and third party data. If an e-commerce store gives you a great product recommendation after your initial purchase, they may have used artificial intelligence to figure out what else you’d be interested in buying.</p>
